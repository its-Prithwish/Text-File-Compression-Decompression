# Text-File-Compression-Decompression
The algorithm used in this code snippet is DEFLATE, which includes Huffman coding as one of its components. DEFLATE is a widely used lossless data compression algorithm that combines LZ77 (a variant of LZSS) for string matching and Huffman coding for symbol encoding.
